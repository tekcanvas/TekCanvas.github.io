Today I will explain how to create the hello world app in react js.

This tutorial requires a basic knowledge on javascript. No prior knowledge on react js is required.

## Introduction

#### What is React? 

[React.js](https://reactjs.org/) a javascript library for building user interfaces, being developed by Facebook Engineers and then it was later open-sourced in 2013. 

## Getting Started: Create React App

**create-react-app** is a command to create React App with default configuration. This will enable us to start writing code immediately. 

Check out the documentation [here](https://create-react-app.dev/) if you have any questions or want to dive in a touch deeper on how the tool works.
